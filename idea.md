Project Plan: Ground-Level Peatland Navigation Assistance
The goal is to process a first-person video to segment the environment, detect objects of interest, and estimate their distance, ultimately creating an augmented view that could power a future navigation app.

Here is a proposed step-by-step plan:

Phase 1: Data and Model Preparation

Data Acquisition:

Action: We will use the 5-minute clip from the "Burns Bog" YouTube video as our source material. The first step will be to download this clip and extract it into individual frames for processing.

Semantic Segmentation Model (Pathfinding & Environment):

Objective: To classify pixels into key categories: walkable path, trees, wet soil, dry soil.

Proposed Strategy: As you suggested, we will leverage public datasets. We will search platforms like Roboflow Universe and Kaggle for datasets focused on trail/path segmentation, forest scenes, and varied terrain.

Technology: We can fine-tune a lightweight and fast segmentation model like Fast-SCNN or use a pre-trained SegFormer transformer, which we know works well from our previous work. The goal is real-time performance.

Object Detection Model (Hazards & Points of Interest):

Objective: To draw bounding boxes around objects like benches, signs, and potential hazards (e.g., large rocks, sudden drop-offs).

Proposed Strategy: We'll again use public datasets for common objects. We've had great success with YOLOv8, so we will stick with that architecture. Its speed and accuracy are ideal for this task. We will fine-tune a pre-trained YOLO model on a combined dataset of these objects.

Phase 2: Core Technology Implementation

Depth Estimation Model (Distance Calculation):

Objective: To calculate the distance from the camera to the detected objects.

Proposed Strategy: Since we only have a single video (monocular vision), we cannot use traditional stereo-vision techniques. Instead, we will use a state-of-the-art, pre-trained monocular depth estimation model.

Technology: I strongly recommend using a model like MiDaS (Multiple Depth Estimation Accuracy with Single Scaled Images). It takes a single RGB image (a frame from our video) and outputs a dense depth map, where each pixel's value corresponds to its estimated distance from the camera. This is a powerful and readily available tool that fits our needs perfectly.

Phase 3: Integration and Synthesis

The Processing Pipeline:

Objective: To combine the outputs of our three models into a single, informative video.

Workflow: We will build a script that iterates through each frame of the source video and performs the following sequence:
a.  Run Inference: Pass the frame to the trained Segmentation, Detection, and Depth Estimation models.
b.  Extract Information:
i.  Get the segmentation mask (the colored overlay for paths, trees, etc.).
ii. Get the bounding boxes for detected objects (benches, signs).
iii. For each detected bounding box, find the corresponding area in the depth map and calculate the average distance.
c.  Visualize: Draw the results onto the original frame. This includes the semi-transparent segmentation overlay, the object bounding boxes with labels, and the calculated distance displayed next to each box.
d.  Stitch Video: Save the augmented frame and, after processing all frames, stitch them back together to create the final output video.
